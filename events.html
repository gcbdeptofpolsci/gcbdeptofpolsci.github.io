Five types of budgets are used in India, general budget, performance budget, zero-base budget, outcome budget, and gender budget. The budget making process in India is started in the month of August-September. A budget circular is issued for this. The Budget Division under the Finance Department issues a budget circular at the end of August or the beginning of September. All the works of the government are determined by the budget. The arrangement of funds for all the schemes run by the government is done through the budget only. The government cannot spend even a rupee without a budget.

All the provisions made in the budget cannot be implemented until it is passed by the Parliament.
